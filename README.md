# My Portfolio Website
https://marktice.netlify.com/<br>
My portfolio website was a project i desire to continue to return to and optimize well into my studies and career.<br><br>
I decided to go for a minimal style with some soft animations and use of color to add character and life.

## Trello board

I used trello extensivley to track my progress and my focus my priorities towards the most crucial tasks. I have used trello in the past for small chores but not for personal projects.

### Inspiration
<!-- I NEED SOME. Quotes, tag lines etc. Why i do what i am doing! -->
<!-- Websites i liked, flow etc -->

### Typography
I decided i wanted a simple and clean san serif font for the main content and then a clean but playful font for main headers. After exploring what was available i settled on Audiowide for the headers, and Montserrat for the content.

### Colors and Wireframes
My color scheme was achieved from extracting colors from my inspiration pictures. I then played around with what worked together, in terms of contrast for the font and background.

## Coding
An early version of my MVP was created very early in the process, before any effort was put into content creation or design. This can be seen from my early commits on github and also from my codepen progress. I wanted to assure i got the basic layout of the site nailed down early so i could continue to build parts of the site to assure what i wanted was actually achievable.

## Tools
### SASS
I decided from the start that i would use this project to learn Sass. I'm very glad that i did as some of the features make organizing and understanding the flow your styling much easier to follow.

### Sitemap Generator
I generated my sitemap using: https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/
I also used the tool to then validate the sitemap.

### Optimisation
I optimized images using: image optim app from the apple app store.

## Testing
I used the pagespeed tester from google to evaluate my sites optimization. I achieved an average score which could be improved apon reducing the render-blocking css used and further optimizing and re-sizing images used.

Overall i am fairly happy with the 'final' product, however i do see areas where i would like to improve and optimize.
