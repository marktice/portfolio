## Coding
An early version of my MVP was created very early in the process, before any effort was put into content creation or design. This can be seen from my early commits on github and also from my codepen progress. I wanted to assure i got the basic layout of the site nailed down early so i could continue to build parts of the site to assure what i wanted was actually achievable.
